### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer working at Honeywell in the UK.

Most of my commits are features for my [personal website](https://declanbyrd.co.uk) but occasionally I like to experiment with technologies that I don't get to use for work related projects.

Things I'd like to do more of:

- Generative art with Canvas API and WebGL
- Progressive web apps
- Write articles for my personal site

Technologies or languages I'd like to learn more about:

- Go
