# Hi I'm, Declan.

I'm currently a software engineer at Twilio. Prior to this, I worked at Honeywell where I contributed to the development of building management systems.

Most of my commits are for my [personal site](https://declanbyrd.co.uk/) as I like to use my personal site to log my progress and what I get up to.
