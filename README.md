### Hi there 👋

I'm a Software Engineering graduate located near Brighton in the UK.

I'm currently learning about the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) and static site generators with particular focus on [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

🏅 My current goal is to start to contribute to open source projects.
